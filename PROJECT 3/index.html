                        Yashasvi Jaiswal made an unbelievable and most inspiring journey from selling ‘Pani Puri’ during
                        the evening and sleeping under a tent to becoming the youngest double centurion in the history
                        of List A cricket at the age of 17 years, 292 days.

                        Yashasvi Jaiswal came under the spotlight when he scored a double hundred while playing for
                        Mumbai against Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2019-20 which made him the youngest batsman
                        ever in List A cricket to score a double century.His career point changed when he was bought by
                        an Indian Premier League (IPL) team Rajasthan Royals for a whopping INR 2.40 crores in IPL 2020
                        Auction.





                        <br>
                        Jaiswal was born on 28 December 2001 in Suriyawan, Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh.
                        He was the fourth of six children to Bhupendra Jaiswal.
                        His father was an owner of a small hardware store, and his mother Kanchan Jaiswal was a
                        housewife.
                        At the age of ten, he moved to Dadar, Mumbai, to receive cricket training at Azad Maidan.
                        As Dadar was far away from the Maidan, he relocated to the Kalbadevi neighborhood where he was
                        given accommodation in a dairy shop in return for low-grade work.
                        He was eventually ejected by the shopkeeper as he was unable to provide much help at the shop in
                        between his cricket training.
                        Having no place of his own, Jaiswal stayed in a tent with the groundsmen at the Maidan, where he
                        often slept hungry and sold panipuri to make ends meet.
                        After living in tents for three years, Jaiswal’s cricketing talent was spotted in December 2013
                        by Jwala Singh, who ran a cricket academy in Santacruz.
